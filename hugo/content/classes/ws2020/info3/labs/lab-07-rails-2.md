## Assignment

### Part 1: Add a Sort or Search Functionality

Each Group should add a sort or search functionality to one of the resources
pages of the HTW app. We will coordinate the tasks using issues on the repository,
see [https://github.com/htw-imi-info3-archive/rails-dash-ws2017/issues](https://github.com/htw-imi-info3-archive/rails-dash-ws2017/issues),
and also coordinate within the lab.

See the [Guide on the Active Record Query Interface](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) - it
contains all necessary
information on how to query and sort Pumpkins and other stuff.

*** remember to make use of all the great pumpkins (and other test data)
all of you added with their
pull request you can use to populate your database! ***

    rake db:seed

(after updating from the main/upstream repository, see [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo))

Select any issue with the Label Sort&Search and make sure that one of your group
is assigned to it.

### Part 2: Internationalization

Each group should internationalize and localize one page of the app.
Alternatively, you can decide to add a special localization.

Again, coordinate using Github issues with the label "Internationalization".

### Part 3: Some more functionality

Add a little bit more of functionality to the app. There are some example
issues labeled with "a little functionality",

## Report / What to hand in

The resulting app should be workable, but you do not need to spend time on the layout!

Hand in one file: a pdf documenting what you&#8217;ve implemented &#8211;
with a link to your fork and to the pull request you've sent for the different
parts.

Make sure to work in small increments, and integrate the source often.
