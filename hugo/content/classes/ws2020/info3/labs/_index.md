## Your time, your progress, your happyness, your responsibility
 You study for your own profit and you spend a lot of time on it. So you are expected to take responsibility for your own learning and happyness, that includes
* asking for help when you need it (just email Linda or write her via Moodle)
* providing anonymous feedback via Moodle
* sharing what you wish to learn
* sharing suggestions for improvement
* being mentally present during the labs

## Remote Labs
Linda Fernsel will teach the labs via BBB only (the BBB room is on Moodle).

## Exercises
* [Exercise 01 - Installation, Git, Node.js, TDD](lab-01-startup)
* [Exercise 02 - Use Cases and Class Diagrams](lab-02-usecases-class)
* [Exercise 03 - Sequence Diagrams and State Machine Diagrams](lab-03-sequence-state)
* [Exercise 04 - Testing](lab-04-testing)
* [Exercise 05 - Legacy Code - Refactoring to Patterns](lab-05-legacy)
* [Exercise 06 - Web Apps with Node and Express I](lab-06-express-1)
* [Exercise 07 - Web Apps with Node and Express II](lab-07-express-2)

## Teams
You are required to work on the exercises and turn them in **teams of  3 people**. All team members need to register for their team on Moodle before each new assignment. Chose the group that corresponds to your lab (group 1 = 8am lab, group 2 = 9.45am lab). You are free to chose any of the remaining team numbers.

## Submissions
You need to
* work with **repositories** when producing code. Share a link to your repository in the Moodle hand in field (the text field)
* write a **report** about what you did and your results. Upload your report in the Moodle hand in field (the file field)
* participate in the **oral test** about the lab (not Lab02 and Lab05)
* only Lab02 and Lab05: Take part in the **peer reviews**

Only one person per team has to do the hand in of repo link and report. All team members have to take the oral test and participate in the peer review.

### Repositories
If you produced any code it should be in a repository in the appropriate lab folder at https://gl-imi.f4.htw-berlin.de/info3-wise2020. Work with the repository from the start on and upload the complete projects, not only parts of code. I expect to find the final solution on the master branch.

### Reports
I trust you to have a feeling for what belongs in a good report. The following requirements of form are new and prepare you for scientific work:
* You write in correct, complete sentences
* You write about facts and your tone is neutral
* Your argumentation is logical
* You cite your sources appropriately ([How to do that?](https://people.f3.htw-berlin.de/Professoren/Pruemper/pdf/RichtlinienHaus-undDiplomarbeiten.pdf))
* You don't write more than necessary
* You write either in German or English, you don't mix languages.

Caro Track will give you feedback for the reports.

**Late submissions** (Update): You may hand in one report (with code if applicable) in the late slot on Moodle until Feb 10, 11pm (each person hands in for themselves, but the report may have been produced in a team). However, you won't have the possibility to take an oral test or participate in a peer review for that report. As always, talk to me if there is a problem. 

### Oral Tests
The progress you make in each lab except lab02 and lab05 will be verified with 10-minute oral tests (1 per group per assignment).

You should be able to:
* explain your results (1P)
* explain your code (1P)
* answer questions about subjects of a lab (1P)

Additionally each team member is required to:
* be able to communicate by microphone
* be able to screenshare

If any of this is not possible, tell me early so we can find a solution.

The order of groups is decided at random. The tests usually take place during the second week of the next lab (eg. the oral test about lab01 takes place in the second week of lab02). If you can not attend the test, talk to me asap. We will try to find a solution together.

### Peer Reviews
Lab02 and Lab05 will be peer-reviewed. There will be no oral tests for these labs, but each person will need to review 3 other lab reports (1P per review).
