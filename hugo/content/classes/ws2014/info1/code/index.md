* You can download the whole archives by using the ZIP Button present on the repository sites. 
* You can also look at single files online on github.
* if you click on commits, you can see the exact changes I made during class. My commit comments should give you a hint, also the date on which they are made to find the right ones. It might look a bit confusing at first because all changes in the BlueJ meta files (ctxt) are recorded as well - just search for the .java file that you're interested in. (e.g. by using cmd-f in the browser)
* One possible way to work with it: download the original version (always in Branch "master" - the first link above), and then check my commits or the current version online to recall the changes we made in class. 
* of course, you might want to start working with git - which you need to do in info3 latest - and just clone the repository. [trygit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is one of the many good starting points that are available online. But if you're just starting off with programming, it's totally fine to wait for 3rd semester with getting into git.

## Note on Code Examples

You find all Code Examples - those from the lectures as well as those for the exercises - on github:
[https://github.com/htw-imi-info1](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1)

Please note that this organization ([htw-imi-info1](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1)) contains all repositories from former semesters. I might update them slightly before class, so if you download them ahead, you might want to subscribe to the repository to be notified in case something changes.

Also note that you don't need to know how to use git in order to use them - there's a download zip button for each repository somewhere.

If I make changes to the source code in class, I commit them into a branch named ws2014 - you can select this branch on the github page and see exactly what I've changed in the commits.
