## Moodle

There are different Moodle Courses for this course this semester: 

* One for the Lecture - [Moodle SU](https://moodle.htw-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=3994) - where you'll find the slides, additional material and the place to upload the lecture notes.
* One for your Lab where you'll upload your lab reports:
    * [Moodle Lab Group 1](https://moodle.htw-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=4070) 
    * [Moodle Lab Group 2](https://moodle.htw-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=4069)

This was necessary because it was the only way to get the groups from LSF into Moodle and automatically create subgroups. Sorry for the confusion, but then you'll see only the lab uploads that are relevant for you.

## Welcome!

Informatics 1 is an introduction to object-oriented programming using the Java language. In this class we will be using BlueJ as the main development environment and learn about writing programs, designing simple algorithms, about control structures, data types and structures, objects and classes. We will start off in Greenfoot, though, teaching a little lady bug to complete simple tasks by programming our first algorithms.

## Language

This class will be held in german, but all (or almost all) written material will
be in English. You are free to choose either language for your written assignments;
as long as you don't switch languages within one sentence and do your best to
adhere to the grammar and spelling rules of the respective language.

## Meetings

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab:

* Lecture: Tuesdays, 9:45 -11:15 and 12:15-13:45 and Wed 14:00-15:30 in WH-C 335
* [Labs:](labs)
  * Group1: Tuesday, 12:15-13:45 in WH C 537 (B. Kleinen) [Moodle Lab Group 1](https://moodle.htw-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=4070)
  * Group2: Thursday, 12:15-13:45 in WH-C 576 (M. Krüger) [Moodle Lab Group 2](https://moodle.htw-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=4069)


## Grades

Your grade in Info1 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated elements of the course (Lecture summaries, lab reports and exam). The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale]({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/grading-scale):

* Lecture summaries: 10%
* Lab reports: 50%
* Exam: 50%

### Lecture summaries
In the Moodle collaboration room you can find a section called "Lecture summaries". You are expected to write 5-10 complete sentences summarizing each lecture.

It is due at 23.00 the Monday for both lectures of the past week. It is either done or not done. I expect you to do 20 out of all (which will be slightly more) to get the full 10% If I find plagiarisms of lecture summaries (especially from the Wikipedia), you will not get any credit for **any** lecture summary.

### Lab Reports
You find detailled information about them on the [Lab Page](labs/)

### Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination at the end of the term. We will have 2 shifts of exams, Group 1 and Group 2. The examination will cover Java programming and conceptual understanding in ways that may be difficult to assess during the laboratory sessions. The exam will be an on-line exam with two parts, a multiple-choice part and an essay / programming part. Please consult LSF for the definite date and time.

## Tutorial and Lernzentrum

If you struggle with this class, need more support with the exercises or simply don't like studying alone:
There is a tutorial held by Alexander Becker and the [Lernzentrum Informatik](https://www.htw-berlin.de/studium/lernzentren/lernzentrum-informatik/) that offer opportunities to practice.
Labor WHC 576

* [Alexander Becker](https://bobafett2000.de), Thurdays 15:45-17:15 WH-C 576

## Java-Tutorials and Book

Most of this lecture will be based on: D. Barnes; M. Kölling: **Objects first with Java. A Practical Introduction using BlueJ**; Pearson Education. 5th edition.

German translation: Barnes, David J., Kölling, Michael: Java lernen mit BlueJ. Pearson, 2012, 5. Auflage. [Pearson](https://www.pearson.de/java-lernen-mit-bluej-9783868949117)

You can also obtain an older editions - example and chapter order vary, but the general information is the same.

There are tons of Java Tutorials out there on the web, my recommendation are the [Tutorials by Sun/now Oracle][7]; especially the [Trail &#8220;Learning the Java Language&#8221;][8], as they are very concise and comprehensive.
