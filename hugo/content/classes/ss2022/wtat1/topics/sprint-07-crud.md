#### Agile Topic: Estimation

Estimate the effort for individal backlog items by means of Planning Poker. Use the Fibonacci numbers
0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21 for scoring.

#### Development Topic: Adding CRUD Support

Lessons 19-21 of Unit 4 describe the necessary steps for adding CRUD (Create - Read - Update - Delete) support to a model.
It describes how to implement CRUD functionality across models, views, controllers as well as by defining the appropriate routes.

Find one or more stories to implement each of the CRUD operations. Not all models need all CRUD operations, and
not all operations need a dedicated view.

##### Topic of the Week

CRUD operations on the database:

- Find one or more stories to implement each of the CRUD operations along with the associated controller and view.
- Work with git. Create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
  - You may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- Tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_07"
- Include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - Please use a public repository or grant read access to the lecturer

#### Status Report

Write up a brief status report containing:

- Your project name
- The names of all team members
- The backlog as a text file
- The stories you've implemented in this sprint
- A reflection on any technical issues that you have encountered and how you resolved them (or not)
  - What happens at the database level if you create a subscription for a non existent user?
- The url of your git repositories

and submit it as .txt or .pdf to Moodle with the filename _Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint07.pdf_ or
_Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint07.txt.
