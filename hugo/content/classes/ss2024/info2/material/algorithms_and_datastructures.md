## Textbooks and Material

The broader topic of this course is Algorithms and Data Structures. You'll find lots of textbooks and other material on this general and all of it singular topics.
I picked out three textbooks:
## 1. Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne: Algorithms, 4th ed.

Excellent Textbook. A condensed version of the text is available on
the companion website: 
[https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

This is a Coursera Course based on this Textbook: [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
as well as [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines) by the same author which we will use for finite state automata.

The Videos on the Companion Website are not free anymore, but the Slides are available as PDFs: [Lectures]](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/)

## 2. Tim Roughgarden: Algorithms Illuminated

Algorithms Illuminated is a book Series by Tim Roughgarden. The Companion Website
contains Videos on all topics (it's basically the complete Coursera Course Videos):

## 3. Aditya Y. Bhargava: Grokking Algorithms (2nd ed.)

Explains the topics very well, and has comic-like sketches.
