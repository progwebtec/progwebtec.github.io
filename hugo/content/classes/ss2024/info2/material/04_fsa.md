## Finite State Automata
Material:

- The course [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines),
[Week 4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines/home/week/4) on Coursera contains an introduction video on Deterministic Finita Automata (DFA)s:
[DFAs | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines/lecture/Jydy3/dfas) (you will need to register, but accessing the material is free)
- neat example in Python which makes use of Pythons ability to pass functions as pameters for the state transitions: [Finite State Machine in Python | Applications Python | python-course.eu](https://python-course.eu/applications-python/finite-state-machine.php)
- Note that Finite Automatas are structurally equivalent to State Machines, for an introduction see: [UML 2 State Machine Diagrams: An Agile Introduction](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/stateMachineDiagram.htm)
