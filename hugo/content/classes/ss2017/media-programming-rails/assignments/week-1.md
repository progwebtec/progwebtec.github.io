## 0. Install Ruby and Ruby on Rails
There are hints for installtation in the Getting Started with Rails Guide linked below.

## 1. contribute to the ruby-learning project
In class, we will / did start a project to learn about ruby:
[https://github.com/htw-imi-m1-ss2017/ruby-learning](https://github.com/htw-imi-m1-ss2017/ruby-learning)

Finish one topic per person.

## 2. create a project vision and backlog
###  a. Write down your project vision.

Example Project: Habits -
An application that supports their user building habits. They can enter habits
they want to build, together with a frequency how often they want to do this
new habit. The App then supports user in keeping track of their performance as
well as reminding them whan it's time for the habit.

### b. Product Backlog
Write down your product backlog. Roughly prioritize it for business value. Don't hesitate to write down as many stories as you want, you don't have to implement them all.
Here's the backlog of the project "Habits:"

- The user sees a list of habits that should be done on the day as the first page.
- A user kann log an habit as completed on that day by simply clicking on a button in the habit list.
- New habits can be entered including name, frequency and a description.
- When the user clicks on a habit, it can be edited. A log of dates when the habit was performed is shown.
- a habit log is shown for each week.

## 3. work through the "getting started with rails"-guide
At least read through the Getting Started Guide. You can and should, however, try to start
to develop your application following the guide.

There is nothing to turn in this week.
