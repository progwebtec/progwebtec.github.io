# Welcome!

This course is an introduction to *algorithms and data structures*. It will be taught in German with all written material in English. It will be taught using the Java programming language, but it is not about the language. Mastery of basic Java syntax as taught in Informatik I is assumed. We learned primitive data types, statements and rules, interfaces and classes in Informatik I. We will now be looking at more complex data structures and algorithms which work on these data structures.

In particular we will be concentrating on how to solve (small) problems using a programming language. At the end of the semester there will be an introduction to
Ruby so that you get a feel for the language and learn something about differences in programming languages.

Have a look at how this breaks down on this (tentative) [Schedule](schedule).

## Meetings/Weekly Schedule

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab. Please refer to the LSF for time and location information (link above).

## Tutorial

There will be a tutorial held by Alexander Becker. This is not obligatory and mainly an additional opportunity to get help on the exercises or with exam preparation.

## Assignments and Grades

For passing Info2, you need to pass two parts:

- the Lab ("Programmierübungen mit Rücksprache")
- the Exam ("Klausur")

### Labs
There will be a new grading schema for the lab reports!

You need to turn Lab Reports for n-1 and get an ok on n-2 of the n issued lab assignments. In the current planning, n == 13.

More info about the Lab Reports and their assessment can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

### Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination. The exam will be an on-line exam with three parts, a multiple-choice part, an essay part, and a programming part.

### Grades

As the lab reports are not graded, you need to pass them with an "ok" to pass the class altogether.

The Grade is determined by the grade of your exam.

No Lecture Notes this term!

Note that as both, Lab Reports and the Exam are parts of the "Modulprüfung", cheating on them will result in a 5,0 (nicht bestanden) for the whole module and use up one of the three possible tries for this module.

### Examinations for Students who already took Info2

If you already took an Info2 class (with Prof. Zhang or Prof. Weber-Wulff) and completed the lab reports/exercise part there, you can skip the lab reports. To do so, you have to
- send an email to the other Professor asking them to send your lab grades to me
- send me an email asking me to accept them (you can do both in one email).

You have to decide wether you want to participate in my labs or not at the beginning of the semester, though. As soon as you turn in one lab report with me, you are participating and have to do all of them to pass.

Whether you attend the lectures or not, is your own decision, but note that the content might differ. It's your responsibilty to inform yourself about the topics covered.
