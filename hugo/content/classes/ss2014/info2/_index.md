# Welcome!

This course is an introduction to *algorithms and data structures*. It will be taught in German with all written material in English and with the Java programming language.It will be taught using Java, but it is not about the language. Mastery of basic Java syntax as taught in Informatik I is assumed. We learned primitive data types, statements and rules, interfaces and classes in Informatik I. We will now be looking at more complex data structures and algorithms which work on these data structures.

In particular we will be concentrating on how to solve (small) problems using a programming language. At the end of the semester there will be an introduction to
Ruby so that you get a feel for the language and learn something about differences
in programming languages.

Have a look at how this breaks down on this (tentative) [Schedule](schedule).

## Meetings/Weekly Schedule

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab:

* Labs & Lecture Notes Due: Mondays, 10:00 a.m. (for Group 1 & 2, Group 3 tba)
  * Thus, there is time before the lab for doing the pre-lab.
* [Labs:](labs)
  * Group1: Tuesdays,   14:00  -  15:30 , WH C 537 (B. Kleinen)
  * Group2: Wednesdays, 12:15  -  13:45, WH C 537 (B. Kleinen)
  * Group3: Fridays, 15:45 - 17:15, WH C 537 (Michele Kr√ºger)
* Lectures:
  * 1: Wednesdays,  17:30  -  19:00, WH C 355
  * 2: Fridays,     14:00  -  15:30,  WH C 355
* Tutorial:
  * Donnerstags, 15:45-17:15 in WHC 576 - Alexander Becker
  * Alexander.Becker@student.HTW-Berlin.de

## Grades

Your grade in Info2 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated elements of the course (Lecture summaries, lab reports and exam). The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale]({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/grading-scale):

* Lecture summaries: 15%
* Lab reports: 40%
* Exam: 50%

### Labs
There will be a new grading schema for the lab reports!

More info about the Lab Reports can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

### Handouts

* [Euclid](./handouts/euclid)

### Lecture summaries (15%)
In the Moodle collaboration room you can find a section called "Lecture summaries". You are expected to write 5-10 complete sentences summarizing each lecture. They are due Mondays 10:00 a.m. You can, of course, hand them in earlier.

If I find plagiarisms of lecture summaries (especially from the Wikipedia), you will not get any credit for any lecture summary at all. Of the 28 lectures altogether, I expect you to write summaries for 24 of them to get the entire 15% - they are either done or not done, and not graded on content.
They can be in txt, pdf or markdown format.

## Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination on or about July 23. We will have 2 shifts of exams, Group 1 and Group 2.  The exam will be an on-line exam with two parts, a multiple-choice part and an essay / programming part.
