The final Report should present your work for this course as a whole, with
an emphasis of the product concept as you've presented it in the final presentation.

Please include the first two reports as well as your presentation slides,
compiling a coherent report on the complete project.

The only new content would be the evaluation of the prototypes as a special
section, and probably a rewrite / addition to the product concept as a result of
this evaluation.
