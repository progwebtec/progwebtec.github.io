Within the class you will design and develop a web application within a small team. Your team is free to choose the topic.

Throughout the project, you will build features into your project that allow you to learn and practice certain aspects of web development and the technology used. See the Schedule and the Topics list for details.

## Meetings and Due Dates

The Campus is closed and there will be no on-site classes at least till April 20, probably longer.

We will still meet at the time scheduled in LSF each week, Links to video conferencing will be posted in Moodle.

Lectures will be done as flipped classroom: You need to prepare the topic beforehand, and I will mostly answer questions during the lectures.

During distance learning, which may be for the whole term, I will make use of the lab time for individual sessions with the teams.

Note that there is required reading to read *before* class.


## Digital Media

Even more than usual, there will be several digital media things supporting this
class. You find the links to Moodle, GitHub, the Wiki and LSF in the top menu as "External Links".
