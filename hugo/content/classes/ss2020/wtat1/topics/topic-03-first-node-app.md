## Sprint 01: First Node App with two static sites

- number the stories in your backlog (see the example below)
- create a static prototype for the most important story or stories in your backlog.
- it should contain at least two different static sites and routes.
- follow the tutorial in unit 01 in the book - create a simple node app without any other framework.
- work with git. create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
- you may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_01"  
- include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - if you have a private repository, make sure to grant me read access

### Example: Module Database

    Story_042 - As a student or lecturer, I see an overview of the whole study program with all modules including Title, Format and ECTS on the site.
    Story_023 - As a student, I can quickly get an overview of the my progress within the study program.
