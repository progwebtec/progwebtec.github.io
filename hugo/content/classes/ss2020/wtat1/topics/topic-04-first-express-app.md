## Sprint 02: First Express App with view templates and dynamic content

- number the stories in your backlog (see the example below)
- choose and implement stories according to this weeks topic
- work with git. create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
- you may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_02"  
- include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - if you have a private repository, make sure to grant me read access

## Step 1: Using Express

Create a new application using express, and migrate your existing views to the new express app. This may result in a new repository, but does not have to.
Chose one or more stories where you can make use of the two new technological topics you've learned in Unit 2: View Templates and Dynamic Content.


## Topic of the Week: View Templates and Dynamic Content

### Layouts and Partials

Look at your whole backlog and choose a story or more that requires a different view from your first stories, and implement it using layouts and partials.

### Passing Parameters in Routes

Find one Story that can make use of a parameter passed in a route and implement it.

### Displaying Dynamic Content

Find a Story that can make use of Passing content from the controller to the view and displaying it with a view template.
