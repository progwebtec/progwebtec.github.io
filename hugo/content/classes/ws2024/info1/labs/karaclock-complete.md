This is a complete overview of the KaraClock Exercises that lead to the implementation of the KaraClockDisplay-Example. The exercises are distributed through three Labs, as shown by the headlines here. 

The material section contains an article about why I made this addition to the ClockDisplay example: [ClockDisplay Example: Reflections and Improvements](/material/info1/clock_display_refactoring/).

Open the Greenfoot-Kara project [`https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/kara-clock-lab`](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/kara-clock-lab).
It contains several test worlds. Make sure you've instantiated the correct test world!

If you haven't already done so, you need to install [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/download) to open the scenarios. The main file is `project.greenfoot`.
