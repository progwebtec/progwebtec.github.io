## Assignment: Gilded Rose Refactoring and Enhancement


Refactor the Gilded Rose and add the requested new functionality.

Last week, you've developed characterization tests for the guilded rose. Secured by that, you're now safe to refactor the given implementation to a good object-oriented design - but don't forget the goblin in the corner!

That is, you can't simply create an Item-Hierarchy where each item knows how to update it's quality. You have to find another solution without touching the Item-Class.
