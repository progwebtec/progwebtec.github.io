# Welcome!

Info 3 is the roundup of the Info 1-3 cyclus. In Info1, you learned programming, and the basics of object orientated design of software. Info2 dived into advanced programming with data structures and algorithms. Info3 rounds that up by giving you insights into how actually design and develop software at a bigger picture.

The Modulbeschreibung states the following goals for Info3:

*  Die Studierenden haben gelernt, wie man ein komplexes Softwarebasiertes
   System analysiert, modelliert und eine L&ouml;sung entwirft.
*  Die Studierende k&ouml;nnen sicher mit Entwurfsmustern umgehen und sie in einer
   aktuellen Programmiersprachen praktisch umsetzen.
*  Die Studierenden haben Modellierungs-Notationen wie UML sicher anzuwenden
   gelernt.
*  Sie haben verstanden, wie sie die Methoden des Software- Engineerings auf der
   Entwicklung von Mediensysteme anwenden k&ouml;nnen.
*  Sie k&ouml;nnen Algorithmen der Lokalisierung und Internationalisierung von
   Software umsetzen.

Thus, Software Engineering, Software System Design, the UML and Software Design Patterns are set as topics.
As one example of media system applications, we will look deeper into Web Application Development. Web Application Development has two main characteristics: it is a fast-changing environment, and agile development practices are pivotal. Furthermore, if web applications are successful, they become long-running software, thus the ability to maintain an old codebasis is also important. Therefore, we will also look into best practices to support agile software development ("Best Practices") as well as designing for ease of change ("Clean Code" and "Advanced Object Oriented Design").

Have a look at how this breaks down on this (tentative) [Schedule](schedule).

## Meetings

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab:

* Lecture: Thursdays, 12:15 - 13:45, WH C 353
* Lecture: Fridays, 12:15 - 13:45, WH C 348
* [Labs:](labs)
  * Group1: Fridays, 09:45 - 11:15, WH C 537
  * Group2: Fridays, 14:00 - 15:30, WH C 537

**Friday first week will be e-Learning!!** (Due to Exams and Neuberufenen-Didaktikfortbildung). This gives you time to set up your tools as described in [Lab Startup](labs/lab-00) - you don't need to hand in anything, but you need to have things set up for the next lab!

## Grades

Your grade in Info3 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated elements of the course (Lecture summaries, lab reports and exam). The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale](({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/grading-scale):

* Lecture summaries: 10%
* Lab reports: 50%
* Exam: 50%

More info about the Lecture Summaries and the Lab Reports can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

## Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination on or about Feb 7. We will have 2 shifts of exams, Group 1 and Group 2.  The exam will be an on-line exam with two parts, a multiple-choice part and an essay / programming part.

## Course Literature

There is no textbook for this class. Here are the main books this class is based upon. You'll don't need to buy them for this class - there's plenty of information online. Some of them can be found in the library. You might want to buy them, though, as these are books that will not be outdated next year. One of them is even the same age as some of you.
