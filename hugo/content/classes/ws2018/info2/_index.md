# Welcome!

This course is an introduction to *algorithms and data structures*. It will be
taught in English and German with all written material in English. It will be
taught using the Java programming language, but it is not about the language.
Mastery of basic Java syntax as taught in Informatik I is assumed. We learned
primitive data types, statements and rules, interfaces and classes in
Informatik I. We will now be looking at more complex data structures and
algorithms which work on these data structures.

In particular we will be concentrating on how to solve (small) problems using a
programming language. At the end of the semester there will be an introduction to
another Programming Language - e.g. Python -  so that you get a feel for the
language and learn something about differences in programming languages.

Have a look at how this breaks down on this (tentative) [Schedule](schedule).

## Meetings/Weekly Schedule

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab. Please refer to the LSF
for time and location information (link above in the External Links menue).

## Tutorial

There will be a tutorial held by Anja Kammer. This is not obligatory and mainly
an additional opportunity to get help on the exercises or with exam preparation.

## Grades & Exam

For passing Info2, you need to pass two parts:

- the Lab ("Programmierübungen mit Rücksprache")
- the Exam ("Klausur")

If more than one report is missing, or finally not graded with an "ok",
or more than four reports are late, you will fail the Lab part of the Modulprüfung,
resulting in not passing the whole Modulprüfung.

There are four "late slots". You can use them to hand in late work - that is,
after the deadline, and before January 25th.
You can use a late slot to hand in a rejected Lab Report again.

Note that as both, Lab Reports and the Exam are parts of the "Modulprüfung",
cheating on any of them will result in a 5,0 (nicht bestanden) for the whole
module and use up one of the three possible tries for this module.

### Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination. The exam will be an online exam
with three parts: a multiple-choice part, an essay part, and a programming part.

The Grade is determined by the grade of your exam.

There is a penalty on the grade for late or missing lab reports, see below.

### Labs

You need to turn in all 13 lab reports. Lab reports won't be graded. We will
review the Lab Reports in the following lab.

Reports are due @ 22:00 the night before the next lab.

There will be a penalty of a 0.3 on the grade if you miss one lab report.
(That is, 1.3 instead of 1.0, 1.7 instead of 1.3 etc.).

11 of the 13 lab reports need to be handed in at or before the deadline.
That is, you can hand in two reports as late as you want as long as it's a week
before the exam.
Please use the two "late reports" slots for that.

There's a penalty of 0.3 on the grade for each if you hand in a third and forth report late.
Please use the "3rd late report" and "4th late report" slots for that.

This should allow for enough slack for the usual winter cold and grandpa's birthday.
If you fall ill for more than a week or are unable to continuously work on
the lab reports for some other reason, come talk to me or at least email me as
early as possible and we will find an individual solution. This will require
proof of the situation.

More info about the Lab Reports and their assessment can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

### Lecture Notes

No Lecture Notes this term!

### Examinations for Students who already took Info2

If you already took an Info2 class (with Prof. Zhang or Prof. Weber-Wulff) and
completed the lab reports/exercise part there, you can skip the lab reports.

To do so, you have to
- send an email to the other Professor asking them to send your lab grades to me
- send me an email asking me to accept them (you can do both in one email).

You have to do that at the beginning of the term, within the first or second
week. I will individually decide on the terms for grading (e.g., if the labs were
graded and counting 50% to the grade I might decide to apply that grading scheme)
and you will want to know this decision beforehand.

Whether you attend the lectures or not, is your own decision, but note that the
content of Info2 might differ. It's your responsibilty to inform yourself about
the topics covered.
