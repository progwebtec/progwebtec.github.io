# User Research: Contextual Interviews and Personas

## Interviews

Conduct Contextual Interviews. Each person in the team should conduct one Interview
of about an hour.

## Interpretation Sessions

You conduct one interpretation session for each interview.
The whole team participates in the interpretation session! You'll probably need more
time than just the time in the lab for the interpretation sessions.

## Personas

Define Personas as described in Chapter 3 in Cooper: About Face.

## What to hand in

Your reports, uploaded as pdf to moodle, should include

* the project title & focus
* the names of all team members
* the persona hypothesis
* a list of the conducted interviews
* the results of the interpretation session
* your Personas

*you create one PDF in the group with all names, and each member of the
group needs to upload this (same) report to moodle*
