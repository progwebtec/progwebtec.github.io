# Web Technology 2 - Usability

Important note: I'll probably open a second Lab for the class
such that all interested can get a spot.

If you want to get in you need to attend in the first week (9.10.) to hear
the plan for the class and in the second week (16.10, if you're still
interested) for topics and group assignments. We will split the lab in
two groups after that if still necessary.

## Grades and Exam

### Lab
There will be 4 Group Assignments in the Lab:

1. [Topic Description and Heuristics](assignments/assignment_01/)
2. [User Research](assignments/assignment_02/)
3. [Design and Evaluation I](assignments/assignment_03/)
4. [Design and Evaluation II](assignments/assignment_04/)

You need to hand in all reports, one report may be late with a penalty of 0.3
grades.

The lab is a non-graded "Teilmodulpr√ºfung".
If you pass the lab, the exam grade will be your overall grade.
If you fail the Lab, it will count with a 5.0 towards the overall grade.

### Exam

There will be a Moodle Exam at the end of the Term.
