# Homework for Week 6 / Sprint 2

1. Prioritize your backlog.
2. Estimate a couple of stories.
4. Create a screen flow for the next or next few stories. Mark these stories as being part of SPRINT2.
3. Using an HTML templating engine / HTML generator library that can be used with your framework to create a click-dummy for the user stories.
4. Make sure to mark the basic installation as your "initial commit" and document each step with a commit reading something like "Story 4711: did this and that"
5. Use the simple git workflow described in the links below to generate merges per story.
3. Tag your project: "SPRINT2" and push it to github (or another git server). Provide a link in your report.
9. Upload your PDF-Report to moodle. Your Report should describe what you did, problems you've encountered and how you solved them - and the project description, the backlog and the stories you worked on during the sprint.
