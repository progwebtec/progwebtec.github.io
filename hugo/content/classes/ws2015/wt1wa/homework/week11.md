# Homework for Week 11 / Sprint 7

You just keep working on your Project, one Story in your Backlog at a time:

- include the backlog in your report. For each story, list
    - its number/id
    - its name
    - storypoints
    - sprint(s) it was/is in (eg. sprint3, or: sprint4(committed, but not completed) sprint5 (completed) etc.)
- include your level of done in each report, such that I don't have to search for it. (you should have that starting with sprint4)
- for each story you've been working on, write down acceptance criteria.
- tests for the stories should be included both in level of done and the acceptance criteria.
- report on what worked, what didn't, how you solved especially difficulties.
- for the described tasks, please include a link to the main file(s) you needed to change for that or make the changes clearly visible in a commit comment (e.g. "Story #38: created search box") and note that in your report.
- Tag your project: "SPRINT7" and push it to github (or another git server). Provide a link in your report.
- Upload your PDF-Report to moodle. Your Report should describe what you did, problems you've encountered and how you solved them - and the project description, the backlog and the stories you worked on during the sprint. See the details above!

And yes, this is the same as last week. Would be great if more than 50% of the reports would adhere to this requirements!
And this is why I don't want links to google docs etc in the reports:
