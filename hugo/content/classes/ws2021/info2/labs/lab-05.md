## Learning Goals

After this lab you should be able to agree with each of the following statements.

I can evaluate the efficiency of algorithms:
* I understand the correlation between input and running time for different program structures
* I can use big-o-notation to describe the running time of algorithms
* I can calculate the running time of algorithms by adding up running times of different structures
* I can compare running times based on their running time in big-o-notation

## Pre-Lab

***P1.*** Programs A and B are analyzed and are found to have worst-case running times no greater than 150 N log N and N<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Answer the following questions, if possible:

a) Which program has the better guarantee on the running time for large values of N (N > 10 000)?

b) Which program has the better guarantee on the running time for small values of N (N < 100)?

c) Which program will run faster on average for N = 1000?

d) Is it possible that program B will run faster than program A on all possible inputs?

***P2.*** An algorithm takes 0.5 ms for input size 100. How long will it take for input size 500 if the running time is the following:

a) linear

b) O (N log N)

c) quadratic

d) 4. cubic

***P3.*** An algorithm takes 0.5 ms for input size 100. How large a problem can be solved in 1 min if the running time is the following:

a) linear

b) O (N log N)

c) quadratic

d) cubic

***P4.*** Order the following functions by growth rate, and indicate which, if any, grow at the same rate.:
- N
- square root of N
- N<sup>1.5</sup>
- N<sup>2</sup>
- N log N
- N log log N
- N log2 N
- N log (N<sup>2</sup>)
- 2/N
- 2N
- 2N/2
- 37
- N<sup>3</sup>
- N<sup>2</sup> log N


## Assignment

### Part 1: Analysis of Algorithms
For each of the following seven program fragments, do the following:

1. Do a Big-Oh analysis of the running time.
2. Implement the code in a simple main class and run it for several interesting values of N.

#### Code Fragments

     // Fragment #1
     for ( int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
         sum++;

     // Fragment #2
     for ( int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
         for ( int j = 0; j < n; j ++)
             sum++;

     // Fragment #3
     for ( int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
         for ( int j = i; j < n; j ++)
             sum++;

     // Fragment #4
     for ( int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
         sum ++;
         for ( int j = 0; j < n; j ++)
             sum ++;

     // Fragment #5
     for ( int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
         for ( int j = 0; j < n*n; j ++)
         sum++;

     // Fragment #6
     for ( int i = 0; i < n; i ++)
         for ( int j = 0; j < i; j ++)
             sum++;

     // Fragment #7
     for ( int i = 1; i < n; i ++)
         for ( int j = 0; j < n*n; j ++)
             if (j % i == 0)
                for (int k = 0; k < j; k++)
                    sum++;

### Part 2: Prime Numbers
A  *prime number* has no factors besides 1 and itself. Do the following:

3. Write a simple method `public static bool isPrime (int n) {...}` to determine if a positive integer N is prime.
4. Compare the running times needed to determine if a 20-bit number and a 40-bit number are prime by running 100 examples of each through your program.

### For the bored:

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method used to compute all primes less than N. Begin by making a table of integers 2 to N.
Find the smallest integer i that is not crossed out - i is prime! (you might want to print it here to see the progress, but really you shouln't mix output within the algorithm) - and cross out all multiples of i (i , 2i , 3i , ....)
Terminate when i is greater than the square root of N. The running time has been shown to be O (N log log N). Write a program to implement the Sieve and verify that the running time is as claimed. If you are *really* bored, animate this with a GUI like on the Wikipedia!

## Lab Report / What to turn in
All info on the lab reports can be found on the [Labs]({{< relref "../labs" >}}) page.

Also answer the following questions in your report.

Additional questions for part 1:
- Which are interesting values for N?
- Compare your analysis with the actual number of steps (i.e. the value of sum after the loop).

Additional questions for part 2:
- In terms of N, what is the worst-case running time of your program?
- Let B equal the number of bits in the binary representation of N. What is relationship between B and N?
- In terms of B, what is the worst-case running time of your program?
- Present the results of your experiment
