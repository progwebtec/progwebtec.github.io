starting with the visions and product concepts this term as this
was the start of your individual project.

## Paper Prototypes in their final state

Include Fotos or other appropriate Form of Documentation of the paper prototypes,
Interpretation Notes of the Interview Sessions and Documentation /
Changes you made based on these interviews.

Videos are also great to include, but please upload them to the mediathek or
somewhere else and just provide a link in your reports.

Include a brief reflection on how you worked with paper prototypes in a remote
way (if you did do it in a remote way).

## Complete Project Overview

The final Report should present your work for your project as a whole, with
an emphasis of the product concept as you've presented it in the final presentation
- this term starting with the second report, as the user data collection was
done together.

Please include the second report as well as your presentation slides,
compiling a coherent report on the complete project.
