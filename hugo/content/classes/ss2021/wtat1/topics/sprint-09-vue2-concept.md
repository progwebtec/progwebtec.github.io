## Sprint 09: More Vue and Concept for using it in your app

Continue learning Vue by working through the tutorial. You won't need
everything, skim through parts, but make sure to [set up some tests](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/testing.html).

Think about how Vue can be used within your app and write down a concept
for the components you will develop. You'll add real time communication
during the last sprint - maybe there's an useful application for that within your app.

Setup a Vue Project using the Vue Command Line Interface (CLI)
[https://cli.vuejs.org/](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

## Backlog and Report

- include your concept, including a description and interface sketches in the report.
- write a summary of what worked, what didn't work and what you've learned as your report and upload it in the moodle area.
- include a personal reflection about the sprint and what you've learned from each team member in the report.
