## Backlog

Write a simple Product Backlog for Your Project.

Don't worry about writing too many stories, or too complex ones. You don't need
to implement all of them - and it will be easier if you have several to choose from for the
sprints. You order your backlog by business value now; but you will pick stories
that can be implemented with the technologies we learn(ed) during the week
for each sprint. I copy the scope of the projects again such that you get an
idea of what will be implemented:

## Scope

Working through different topics of web development with node and react, you
will develop a web application that has

* at least one model class that can be created, read, updated and deleted
* a user model
* user authentication
* something with real-time communication (e.g. a chat or notification service)
* and some interactive elements created with Rest

Thus, try to sketch something that has these elements in it. It's ok if your idea
is more complex - you will not need to implement all aspects that you describe now.

## Group and Hand-In

You can create the backlog in the groups we set last week.

In the Uploads provided as PDF, please include the Proposal, the names of all members of the group as well as your backlog.
