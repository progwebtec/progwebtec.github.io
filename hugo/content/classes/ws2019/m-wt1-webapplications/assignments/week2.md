# Homework for Week 2
1. Make sure that you're clear on the associations between the classes in your domain model.
2. Create Migrations for adding the foreign keys and, if needed, association tables to the database. Write down the commands you used. You should have at least two associations of different kinds.
3. Run the migrations.
4. Experiment using the rails console to create AR Instances and Associations.
5. using this, create a rake task db:populate to create example data.
8. Tag your project: "WEEK02" and push it to github.
9. upload your PDF-Report to moodle.

update 5.11.2015 19:30: as we didn't cover all of the topics, these two things will be
postponed to next week:

6. Decide on (at least) one more advanced view making use of an association, design and implement it.
7. Find a way to practice working with the request parameters that makes sense in your application, e.g.
     - implement a search
     - implement a sort on a field
     - create forms editing more than one object
