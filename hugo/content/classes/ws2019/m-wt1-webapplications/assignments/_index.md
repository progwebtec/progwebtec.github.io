Handing in the assignments is not a requirement for passing the class.
They guide you through the project process, though - and providing them by
Wednesday helps me see your progress and possible issues we need to discuss
in class.

* [Startup](homework0)
* [2. Assignment](homework1)
* [Homework 3: Paper Prototype Usability Test, Soure Code Setup](homework3)
