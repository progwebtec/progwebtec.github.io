## Assignment 3

This weeks work has two main parts:

- perform a Paper Prototype Usability Test
- Set up your Project with SCM

### Paper Prototype Usability Test

Use the time in class to run a brief usability test based on your paper prototypes.
Make sure you're testing a clearly defined tasks, and assign the roles User, Human Computer,
Facilitator/Notetaker and Oberservers as described in [Paper Prototyping As A Usability Testing Technique](https://usabilitygeek.com/paper-prototyping-as-a-usability-testing-technique/).

* [10 min Video of a Paper-Prototype Usability Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dre0P4tRTc)
* further articles in moodle

### Project Setup/SCM

As we want to compare the different web frameworks make sure you trace all
steps with git:

- commit the original source code (scaffold, just downloaded, before you made any changes) with "initial commit"
- create a branch for each story
- in the branch, commit little steps
- keep dead-ends (things you tried but didn't work) as branches, push and use them for documentation
- create an github issue for each Story
- after the story is completed, merge or rebase all changes with one commit:
"Story xyz: bla bla, #closes issue number" into master.

- I'll create (private if you prefer) repos under https://github.com/htw-imi-wt1wa-ws2019
- please send me your github login in the subject of an email:
"github for webapplications: <your-github-login>

## What to hand in

- Please include the names of all team members on the PDF reports **and the goal of your project**
- User Story Maps again with clear distinction of what belongs to a MVP
- a brief documentation of the paper-prototype test with results
- First Story: Title and maybe a brief description. This is probably only a part of your MVP.
- Link to your github repo under https://github.com/htw-imi-wt1wa-ws2019


bis DIENSTAG abend 22:00 als PDF in Moodle hochladen.
