#### Agile Topic: Daily Scrum

As one of the most frequent meetings, get into the habit of holding a daily stand up meeting to exchange with other team members.

#### Development Topic: Adding Mongo Support

Based on Unit 3, "Connecting to a Database", you'll implement persistence with Mongo DB and Mongoose (lessons 13-14). The functionality
implemented will be showing listings and single items of one resource, as well as creating new records (no editing yet).

##### Topic of the Week

Database connectivity, queries:

- Look at your backlog and choose one or more stories that require you to create and read persistent data. Implement it using models.
- Work with git. Create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
  - You may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- Tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_04"
- Include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - Please use a public repository or grant read access to the lecturer

#### Status Report

Write up a brief status report containing:

- Your project name
- The names of all team members
- The backlog as a text file
- The stories you've implemented in this sprint
- A reflection on any technical issues that you have encountered and how you resolved them (or not)
  - How long does it take to insert a new document into a Mongo collection?
- The url of your git repositories

and submit it as .txt or .pdf to Moodle with the filename _Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint04.pdf_ or
_Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint04.txt_.
