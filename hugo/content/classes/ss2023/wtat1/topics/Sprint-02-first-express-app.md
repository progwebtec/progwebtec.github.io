#### Agile Topic: Product Owner

Name a product owner in your Scrum team. Set up your project and create a formal backlog as a plain text file (in the team but
with the product owner leading). Note: we will not use a dedicated tool for managing backlogs in this class. Their use is too
involved and therefore not in scope

#### Development Topic: Installing and Understanding Express.js

Setup Express and understand the basic structure of the framework as described in Unit 2 of the book (lessons 8 and 9).

##### Topic of the Week

Middleware and routes:

- Choose and implement stories according to this weeks topic. Find one story that can make use of a parameter passed in a route.
- Work with git. Create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
  - You may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- Tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_02"
- Include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - Please use a public repository or grant read access to the lecturer

#### Status Report

Write up a brief status report containing:

- Your project name
- The names of all team members
- The backlog as a text file
- The stories you've implemented in this sprint
- A reflection on any technical issues that you have encountered and how you resolved them (or not)
  - Which error message is returned to the client if you throw an uncaught error in your implementation of the get() method?
- The url of your git repositories

and submit it as .txt or .pdf to Moodle with the filename _Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint02.pdf_ or
_Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint02.txt_.
