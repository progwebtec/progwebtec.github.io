#### Agile Topic: Definition of Done

Discuss the "Definition of Done" for the items in your sprint backlog.

#### Development Topic: Adding Login Support

Add support for user login, following lessons 22-23 of unit 5 of the book. Note that this unit only covers authentication
but no authorisation. Restricting access to parts of the application will be handled during the next sprint.

##### Topic of the Week

User login, password hashing:

- Add support for user login based on user id and password.
- Work with git. Create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
  - You may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- Tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_08"
- Include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - Please use a public repository or grant read access to the lecturer

#### Status Report

Write up a brief status report containing:

- Your project name
- The names of all team members
- The backlog as a text file
- The stories you've implemented in this sprint
- A reflection on any technical issues that you have encountered and how you resolved them (or not)
  - Is the password protected when transmitted from the client to the server? If not, how could this be addressed?
- The url of your git repositories

and submit it as .txt or .pdf to Moodle with the filename _Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint08.pdf_ or
_Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint08.txt.
