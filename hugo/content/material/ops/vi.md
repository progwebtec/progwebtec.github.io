# VI
You should learn a couple of vi commands to survive, as vi is available on most *nix computers.

## The absolute minimum
There are two modes in vi: normal and insert.
You need to know which mode you are in, as different commands are available.
[(Why this may be problematic has been discussed thoroughly in the UX field)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modes/)
- Normal Mode:
	- vi starts there
	- **get there with `ESC`**
	- start command with`:`
	- `:w` write (save) file
	- `:q` quit (without save, wonâ€™t quit if there are changes)
	- **`:wq` quit and save**
	- `:q!` quit without save no matter what
	- < `h`  ^` j`    v `k ` >` l ` the keys under your right hand double as cursor keys; this makes editing fast!
- Insert Mode:
	- type to insert text
	- get there with any insert command, eg
		-  **`i` insert before cursor**
		- `a` insert after cursor
		- `o` insert in new line after this one
		-  `O` insert in new line before this one
