# Notes on Sketchnotes

To get started with sketchnotes, I recommend one of the sketchnote workshops held at Re:publica (about 1h):

* [the one at Republica 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJKK9m5-xEY) is great, but the sketches on the flipcarts
are sometimes hard to see.
* [in 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBq9VoRJQWU&t=1400s) they projected the sketchnotes, but mirror-inverted :)

If you want to dig deeper:
* [Martin Rhode](http://rohdesign.com) coined the term with ["The Sketchnote Handbook"](https://rohdesign.com/handbook), here's his [Sketchnote Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fi3kHDs0rg)
* [Kathy Schrock on Sketchnoting in Education](https://www.schrockguide.net/sketchnoting.html)
* [Ãœber Sketchnotes, lehren und lernen](https://sketchnotes.de/2013/04/11/ueber-sketchnotes-lehren-und-lernen/)

# On Visual Notetaking in General
