I often recommend to write a suite of (automatic) tests to explore a programming language
and compile your own "cheat sheet" for the language.

By keeping the test suite "green", you can be sure that everything you see in the 
source code is actually working.

I drew this idea from two sources: [Jim Weirich's Ruby Koans](https://www.rubykoans.com/) and the 
recommendation of API Testing by Michael Feathers.

[Jim Weirich's Ruby Koans](https://www.rubykoans.com/), are a big
suite of prepared test cases where you have to fill out the test expectations to learn ruby
with a strong emphasis on edge cases - where ruby works in a special way that may not be
totally clear or deductible from other programming languages. This idea has been transferred to
many other programming languages, e.g. [Greg Malcoms Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans).
