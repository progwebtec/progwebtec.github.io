Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt talk about writing the first and second edition 
of the Pragmatic Programmer. 

They also mention the technique of creating a cheat sheet: writing 
down the important bits and using unit tests to learn something new and 
attribute it to Matt Clark.

"people mention the dry principle all the time and they get it wrong!"
