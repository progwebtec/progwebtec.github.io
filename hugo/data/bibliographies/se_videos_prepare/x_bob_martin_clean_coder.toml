notes = '''
Entertaining Talk about the importance of software design
and Clean Code, starting with the origins of object oriented design
as described by Ivar Jacobson, Use Cases, the origins of MVC. 
"The Architecture maximizes the number of decisions not made, 
a good architecture allows mayor decisions to be deferred - it opens options, does not close them down - 
The Architecture should make the choice of tools irrelevant"
Not recommended as an introduction, rather for entertainment and reflection at the end of term 
(Sai Dubbaka in the comments: ": You know you're a geek when you start to prefer these kind of talks to standup comedy.")
