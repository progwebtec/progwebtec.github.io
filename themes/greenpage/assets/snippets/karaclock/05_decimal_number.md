#### 5. Decimal Number

Now, with a DigitDisplayKara that can count and increment its leaves, you can use it to build a number - 
where DigitDisplayKara has a placeValue (e.g. 1,10,100,1000 etc for Decimal Numbers).

1. Open the World `DecimalNumberWorld` - with the implemented methods, it should work! Experiment with calling act() and run().

2. For the Curious: (optional) Duplicate `DecimalNumberWorld` to create a number with a different base - e.g. `BinaryNumberWorld` for base 2.
Change the BASE constant to 2 and try it out by calling act() and run().
