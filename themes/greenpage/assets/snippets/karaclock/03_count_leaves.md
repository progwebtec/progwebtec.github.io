#### 3. Count Leaves (and go back)

1. Open TestWorld4 again. Complete the method `public int count()` in `DigitDisplayKara`.
   It should combine the `public int moveUpAndCount()` and `public int multiMove()` methods (that is, use them both by calling them) to walk up, count the leaves, return to the original position and return the number of leaves counted.

2. When you're done, test your method in `TestWorld6Count`, which contains some edge cases like a full row and one with zero leaves.
