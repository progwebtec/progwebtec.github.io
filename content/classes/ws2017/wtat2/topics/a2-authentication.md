The second assignment is to implement an authentication for your application.
Furthermore, you learn how to enforce code styling for your project.

## Integrate Bootstrap

Integrate Bootstrap into your Application. Use Bootstrap 4 (currently in beta),
and comes with sass integration and it's own [ruby gem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem/blob/master/README.md):

You don't need to change any styling yet.

* [Documentation in the Example Project](https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat2/IMICalendar/blob/master/doc/bootstrap.md)
* [See the IMI-Calendar-App Commit for Bootstrap integration.](https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat2/IMICalendar/commit/c56aae2c90cfc6fb3710d8bc38d9310d18135629)

## Testing with RSpec

Integrate the Rspec Testing Framework and develop at least one happy path feature
test for each finished user story you've completed so far.

* [Documentation in the Example Project](https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat2/IMICalendar/blob/master/doc/rspec.md)
* See the commits marked with A2-rspec in the [Commit History](https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat2/IMICalendar/commits/master)

## Authentification with Devise

Decide on the model you want to use for authentication (user? member? student?)
and integrate Devise as described in the Devise documentation and Chapter 2.

Follow the tutorial there to create a pleasing login
with Bootstrap.

* [Documentation in the Example Project](https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat2/IMICalendar/blob/master/doc/devise.md)
* See the commits marked with A2-devise in the [Commit History](https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat2/IMICalendar/commits/master)


## Implement one other Story Test Driven

Identify one other story to implement, write at least one end-to-end test
first and implement the story.

We will create an example in class.
