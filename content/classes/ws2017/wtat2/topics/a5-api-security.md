## External APIs

Research possible external APIs that might be useful for your project
(e.g. a weather api for a hiking site enabling you to show the current
weather).

Find or define Stories in your Backlog to use the API. It doesn't have to
be much, the focus is more on using the API than building a lot of new
features into your app.

Write an Adapter and Tests for the API as discussed in class.

## Rails Security

Find one or two (depending on the complexity) possible security issues to
improve in your app. Describe in the report why you chose them and what you did
to improve on them.

## Don't forget the tests
Don't forget to write tests for your new features and to groom your test suite along the way.

## Upload
As always, upload a PDF report containing your updated Backlog, the names
of all collaborators and a link to your repository to moodle.
* updated Backlog: clearly marked completed storys and the stories you worked on/completed this week.
* report on how you worked on the stories. This may be brief, but this week it should contain some text on which kind of search you implemented, what went well and where you've encountered problems, and what you've learned.
* Tag the version after this week completion with week-5
