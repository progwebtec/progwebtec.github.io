## Exercises
* [Exercise 01 - Installation, Git and Ruby](lab-01-startup)
* [Exercise 02 - Use Cases and Class Diagrams](lab-02-usecases-class)

* [Exercise 06 - Rails First Steps](lab-06-rails-1)
* [Exercise 07 - Rails Associations and Internationalization](lab-07-rails-2)

In the Info3 lab, we will do quite different things:

 * Design a Software System with the UML
 * Practice Software Testing
 * Fix a weird piece of legacy software
 * Get our feet wet with Ruby and Ruby on Rails and marvel at the patterns we find in there

There will be 7 exercises. The exercises will either be written reports - lab reports - or the documents you produce in your design with UML, usually not the source code itself. I might, however, ask to turn it in as well.

You are required to work on the exercises and turn them in **groups of  3 people**. Submissions are done in Moodle, **no late submissions** are allowed this term. Always hand in what you have on time.
