---

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the exam will be replaced by continuous assessment.
The continuous assessment consists of a series of assignments. They have to be
handed in individually, except for CA4, Clean Code Poster.

These assignments replace the exam part in the [class' overall grading](../#grades),
the overall grading scheme and the Lab part is not changed.


##  Assignments

These are the the assignment slots with grading points. The assigments are marked in moodle as "CA#"

| ID  | Assignment                                   | Possible Topics | Points | Due Dates PZ1   | Due Dates PZ2         |
|:----|:---------------------------------------------|:----------------|:-------|:----------------|:----------------------|
| CA1 | Design Patterns Report                       | GoF Patterns    | 5      | 4.12.2020       | 21.3.21               |
| CA2 | Topic Report 1                               | All             | 5      | 13.1.2021       | 21.3.21               |
| CA3 | Topic Report 2                               | All             | 5      | 29.1.2021       | 21.3.21               |
| CA4 | Clean Code Poster (Group Work)               | Clean Code      | 10     | 16.12.2020      | Individual Assignment |
| CA5 | Code Reading or Refactoring                  | All             | 15     | 12.2.2021       | 2.4.21                |
| CA6 | Oral Consultation                            | n/a             | 10     | 3./5./10.2.2021 | 26.-31.3.2021         |
| CA7 | Bonus: Watch and Summarize a Conference Talk | any             | 5      | 12.2.2021       | 21.3.21               |

Except for CA1 & CA4, you can choose any Topic Area for the assignments, but each topic area only once, such that you
have to cover 3 out of the 7 listed below. CA7 can be about any Topic Area, also one that you have already covered.

Each Assignment will be graded using [stars](/studies/grading/guideline/#star-gradings-for-exercises), with 4 stars equaling 5P, multiplied by 2 or 3 for CA4-6.
Sum: 50 Points, 55 with Bonus. 50 Points count as 50 or 100 % depending on your option.

You may and should communicate about your work on the assignments, but the work needs to be individual work ultimately.
The combination of assigment, topic area and application projects give a wide variety of individual
combinations. Especially if you are in a study group I advise you to **not** choose the same combination, because your
work will be hard to differentiate. If I find reports that are too similar, they
will not be awarded any points.
Apart from that, I encourage you to share, discuss and review your work. If
you want to protect yourself, you might want to exchange your work in a way that
proofs original authorship, e.g. the wiki or github.

## Topic Areas

These are possible Topic Areas.

## Legacy Projects for Examples, Code Reading and Refactoring

* [one of my software projects](/software_projects)
* npm modules
* Source Code from other classes, e.g. Bildverarbeitung
* other software projects you are involved with

* ...

## CA1 Design Patterns Report

You need to report on two more patterns. The Report should be one handwritten A4 Page in Landscape *for each pattern*, with a brief summary of the pattern on the left half and a description and reflection of the chosen example on the right half, each with an hand drawn UML diagram.

1) Read the Catalogue of Design Patterns of the Gang of Four Book and choose one that you already know an example of. There are some examples in Info1+2, but probably also in other classes' programming exercises.

2) Do the same for the randomly assigned pattern.

Exchange and discuss the work in your peer groups.

Your reports need to be handed in by Friday of next week.

## CA2 & 3 Topic Report 1 & 2

Please use the following structure:

* Assignment: Topic Report 1 or 2
* Topic Area: ...
* Overview
* Detailed Discussion of... (according to scope)

## CA 4 Clean Code Poster

Prepare a poster for one chapter in a group and present it in class (16.12.2020) The Groups are organized in the Wiki: [https://wiki.htw-berlin.de/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97455143](https://wiki.htw-berlin.de/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97455143). This should be done during class, so there is not really an opportunity to redo it in PZ2.

## CA 5 - Code Reading or Refactoring
You can choose to **either** do a Code Reading or a Refactoring:

### Code Reading

Pick any Legacy Project see below, assess the software architecture and report on it as discussed in the lecture on code reading (see [Schedule](../schedule)).
Pick a Topic Area and identify and document the Topic Area in regard to the Legacy Project.
E.g. if you combine Code Reading with the Topic Area Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, you should be able to identify and describe >= 2 Patterns mentioned in POEAA in the software.

### Refactoring

Pick any Legacy Project, and suggest a sensible refactoring that should be applied.
Pick a Topic Area and identify and document the Topic Area in regard to refactoring the Legacy Project.
E.g. if you combine Code Reading with the Topic Area Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, you should be able to identify one Pattern in the software and suggest another one that the project could be refactored to and how it might be done.

## CA 6 - Oral Consultation

This will be an individual oral consultation of about 15-20 min covering your completed assignments,
and a discussion of your larger project CA5 which is still in progress.

## CA 7 - Bonus: Watch a video

Choose, watch and summarize a video of a conference talk of about 45 min to 1 hour.
The video should cover or relate to one of the Topic Areas.
Summarize the video with text or a sketch note. You can choose any conference
talk (not "Patterns for Dummies in 7 minutes!") -  e.g. Talks by
