The German ''Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik'' published Ethical Guidelines
in 1994 that were updated in 2004. They are available online at
https://fg-ie.gi.de/ethische-leitlinien.html.

We will first have a closer look at the Ethical Guidelines, and then
in groups of 3-4 persons you will choose one of the scenarios to
read, discuss, and present to the class. Every member of the group
will submit their own PDF version with a reflection on the scenario
and how the Ethical Guidelines apply to this case. These are not
group work, but will be done individually and submitted to the
Moodle area.
