After having a look into designing an object-oriented application in lab 1 and 2, we will do a lot of small-scale programming in Java during this term. As in Info1, each lab has a pre-lab part, that you are expected to do before coming to the lab, an assignment that you work on during the lab. Usually, you're expected to turn in a report on what you did during the lab.

There are a couple of important changes for the labs compared to Info1:

1. You are required to work on the exercises and turn them in in randomly determined pairs (2 people). Submissions are done in Moodle, **no late submissions** this term. Always hand in what you have on time. Each of the two members in a pair hand in the same report; if only your pair uploads it, you won't get points for it.

1. You are required to be able to present/explain your work **in the following lab** ("review"). How this is done will change from lab to lab, depending on the topic of the lab: one of you might be randomly chosen to present the work, I might talk to each or some of you individually, or it might even be a little quizz in moodle which should be easy to solve if you did the lab exercise.

If I find out that you most probably didn't work on the lab yourself, you will not get an ok. If that happens more than twice, you will fail the lab reports.

Note that this is a (possibly) different thing than plagiarism. Plagiarism - copying the work of others - is considered cheating and will lead to failing the whole course.

If you become ill, it's ok to skip one lab report (remember, only n-1 need to be turned in.). If you're having trouble keeping up for longer than a week, come talk to me or send me an email and we'll figure something out.
