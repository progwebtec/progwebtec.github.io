# Welcome!

This is a practical class in User Centered Design.

You will choose your own project to work on and go through a UCD Process during
the course of the term.

This is a practical class, there will be short lecture parts, but the main part
of the course will consist of reading and practical work on your project in a
small team. The workload per week is
about 9 to 10,5 hrs (in accordance with the 5 ECTS you earn), that is, an
additional 7 to 8 hrs on top of the time spend in class.

Have a look at the [schedule](schedule) to see how this breaks down. If needed,
further information will appear on the [Reports](reports) page.

You are expected to report on your project two times during the term: One
intermediate report (will be scheduled depending on the number of teams in class)
and one final presentation towards the end.

## Grading

There are three reports to hand in via moodle, and a two project presentations
including slides. Each of this counts 1/5 towards the grade:

* Report I: User Research
* Report II: Product Design
* Report III: User Testing
* Intermediate Project Presentation (Actual Presentation & Slides)
* Presentation (Actual Presentation & Slides)

Reports I+II are due the night before in the specified week.
Presentation Slides of your intermediate presentation are due a day after this presentation.
Report III + the presentation slides are due 1 week after final project presentations.
