## Grading

Programming is something you can&#8217;t learn out of a book &#8211; you have
try out things yourself and practice! Therefore, this class will have lots of
exercises. In the Labs you will have opportunity to work on them, and, most
importantly, **ask questions**  or **discuss it with others** if something is
unclear to you or you are stuck somewhere.

## Group Work
Talking to each other and working in pairs or groups is also highly encouraged
during the labs. This term, I will make a ***raffle for new groups of three
for every set of 3 exercises***. This will be done in the labs, so please email
me if you can't attend the lab - I will make a separate raffle of all who didn't
attend. So you will need to meet up with others to work on the exercise even if
you didn't come to the lab. ***I will not accept assignments that are not
prepared in those random groups.***


### Lab reports

For each week you must write a report. The report must be in English or German,
spell-checked and using complete sentences, explaining what you did in the
exercise session, that is, the process. Screenshots are welcome. Each report
should not be more than 5 pages and in PDF format and must have your names on it.
It must include a reflection on what you learned during the session.
They must be submitted to the Moodle area by 22.00 the night before your next lab.


[Last semesters, I found it necessary to clarify some more things about the reports.]({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/guideline)
