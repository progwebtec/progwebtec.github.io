# Intro

Learn python with unit tests: [https://github.com/htw-imi-info2/learn-python-with-tests/tree/ws2018](https://github.com/htw-imi-info2/learn-python-with-tests/tree/ws2018)


# Algorithms and Datastructure Examples from "Introduction to Programming in Python"

Home Page of the Book: [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home)

## Installation
You need to install a couple of additional packages to be able to run most
of the examples in the book. See the To get started
section on the  [Home Page](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home) -
you can stop above "Configuring IDLE" if you already have a way to edit and
run python programs on your computer.

## Exercises

### Find out the length of the longest word

Write a little Program that outputs the length of the longest word.
(e.g. for sowpods.txt)

### Examples for Algorithms and Data Structures

The Chapter [](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/40algorithms/) contains a lot of
interesting examples for algorithms and data structures. My recommendations:

* Partition (15)
* Quicksort (17)

### Pythagoras Tree

Program a pythagoras tree using turtle grafics, see
