# Discount Usability

The Nielsen Norman Group maintains a great web site with a wealth of information and material about Usability, User Centered Design and User Experience. Starting with [Discount Usability 30 Years](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/discount-usability-30-years/) read about either - or all - the three mentioned methods: simplified user testing with 5 users, early test of paper prototypes, and heuristic evaluation. Your goal is to learn enough about either one of this three methods to apply it within a project.

# Static Site Generators

* checkout one static site generator, e.g. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
* Work through a getting started example, e.g. [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
* decide on a project you want to try with it and write a Notice of Intent - what you plan to do with the static web site generator and commit it to moodle till next week.
* your project report about Static Site Generators is due till end of term (details in moodle) - describe what you did, what worked well and issues you've encountered, with screenshots of your project and an url if you decided to publish it.

# Agile Development, DevOps and Continuous Deployment
