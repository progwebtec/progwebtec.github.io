# Sprint 06 User Authentication

Build in a User Authentication and some extras according to  
Unit 5 - "User Authentication".

Sprint 06 in the Module-Handbook example application:  
[https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat1/module-handbook/releases/tag/Sprint_06](https://github.com/htw-imi-wtat1/module-handbook/releases/tag/Sprint_06)

Note that this unit only covers authentication - establishing the identity of
the user - but no authorisation. Restricting access to parts of the application
will be handled during the next sprint.

# Sprint 06 Extras

To add some more protection against attacs, add helmet.js.

To be compliant with the GDPR / DGSVO, the website needs a data privacy policy
and a cookie banner if available to the public.
My profession is computer science, not law, so I can't give you any advice on this.
