Unit 4 - Building a User Model - is a rather long unit, thus we will take two
 weeks to work through it. The technical topics are:

- CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete actions on Models in the Rest architectural style
- Validations
- Model Associations

It discusses CRUD by creating CRUD functionality via model, views, controller and routes for
the User model.

You will need a user model for authentication in addition to your individual models.
You can just copy and adapt the model from the example application,
and adapt it such that it fits to your application domain.

Find one or more stories to implement at least one of each:

- validation
- model association
- index
- create
- read
- update
- delete

You will find that not all models are in need of all crud actions, and that
not all actions need a dedicated view.

You can spread the stories and tasks over the 2 weeks & sprints as you like,
but it's probably easier if you do it in the order of the book (as listed above).

Write at least one test for each story.
Don't forget to update your seeds.

__don't overlook chapter 17.2., Testing models in REPL__ - testing parts of your application interactively can save you lots of time!
