In this exercise, you will create a rails application and add one or two features to it in which you work with the Model, View and Controller.

Pick one simple thing that you can solve mainly with the provided CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) features of a rails scaffold using just one model class. If the first things seems to simple for that, add a second &#8211; but the goal is really to implement just a little bit of functionality in this first step and mainly set up the whole rails app together with Continuous Integration &#8211; we will add Continuous Deployment in the next exercise.

We will do the steps together in the lab, this semester's example app  will be
