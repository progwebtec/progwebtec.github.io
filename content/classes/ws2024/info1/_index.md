## Welcome!

Informatics 1 is an introduction to object-oriented programming using the Java
programming language. In this class we will be using [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/) and it's extension [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/) (for the Kara exercises) as development environment.
You will learn about writing programs, designing simple algorithms, about
control structures, data types and data structures and last not least object oriented
programming - about Objects and Classes.

## Language

This class will be held in a mixture of German and English.
Most written material will be in English.
You are free to choose German or English for your written assignments.

## Class Structure and Meetings

According to the curriculum, Informatics 1 is planned with 2 lectures and 1 lab
per week. Lectures are called "Seminaristischer Unterricht" (SU) in the StuPo,
90 min each with all 40+ students attending the class. Labs are the "(Praktische) Übung" (PÜ)
with smaller groups of 20 students.

This will be organized as follows:

### Lectures

Lectures cover the general knowledge and understanding of the topic.
The actual lectures (talk and slides) will be rather compact with a 
lot of practical exercises during the lecture time.

If you feel you need more input & explanations, you can find plenty of resources
online, see the [Resources](./resources) pages for an orientation.
### Labs

Currently, Labs are planned for Fri 12:15-13:45 and 14:00-15:30. A third lab may be opened if needed.

See the [Labs](./labs) page for more information.

#### Tutorial

There will be an additional tutorial, tba.

## Grading

The grade will be a weighted mixture of the following parts:

* 50% [Lab Reports](labs/)
* 50% Exam
*  8% Lecture Notes

This sums up to a total of 108 % and will be graded according to the
[Grading Scale](/studies/grading/grading-scale) .

## Important Links and Further Information

Information on this class is dispersed on several locations depending on the nature of the information and wether it can be public or not.

These places are in detail:

* This Web Page for all information that may and should be publicly accessible,
  especially the [Schedule](schedule), the [Resources](resources), and the [Lab](labs) exercises, and further general information as the [Grading Scale](/studies/grading/grading-scale).
* [Moodle](https://moodle.htw-berlin.de) for all Information that cannot be made publicly available and for handing in your lecture summaries and lab reports.
