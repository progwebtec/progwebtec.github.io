The Exam for Info3 (Modulprüfung) consists of two Parts (Teilmodulprüfungen):

- written Moodle Exam at the end of term (PZ1) or start of next term (PZ2): 50 Points
- Labs + Optional Showtime Lab: 55 Points

Points for the two Parts will be added for the Percentage (yes, 105% are possible)
and the grade mapped according to the [Grading Scale](../../../../studies/grading/grading-scale).

### Lab Grading

You need to work on the labs in Groups of 3-4 students and prepare a 
Lab Report together which is due 22:00 the night before your next Lab.
You need to present/discuss your lab report during the next Lab session 
to earn an "OK" for the Lab. Each individual Student may miss one Lab Review.

As always, if you have difficulties keeping up with the schedule due to personal reasons
come and talk to me.


## Late Submission

Each Group may hand in one Lab Report at the end of term - consult the schedule for
the Late Lab Review date.

## Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination at the end of the semester.

## I have already taken Info3 last semester and passed the labs:

Congrats! Tell Prof. Kleinen and the Prof that taught your previous Info3 you would like to use your lab results for this term.
