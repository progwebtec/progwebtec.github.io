1. Read up on Inheritance in the book - Chapter 10 mainly, we also already covered parts of Chapter 11&12.
2. You may also or instead watch the videos for the respective chapters [linked from the resources page](../../resources#textbook-videos).
3. Practice and test your understanding of inheritance using the {{< source path = "InheritancePlayground" >}} project.
4. Work on [Lab10](../../labs/exercise-10/). It is sufficient if you use the version in [your-zuul-command-hierarchy](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/exercise09-zuul/tree/main/your-zuul-command-hierarchy)
    Read the source code of `Command.java` and it's subclasses (Go, Help, Quit...) to see how the command hierarchy cleans up the code by moving all commands to their respective small subclass of `Command`. Study `CommandWord.java` to see how the correct class is instantiated.
5. If you missed the Refactoring Part for Lab09, make sure you also read Chapter 08 and do the refactoring of Rooms & their exits for Lab10.
6. Provide a brief summary of what you did as lecture notes for 2/1/2024 in Moodle.
