## Welcome!

Informatics 1 is an introduction to object-oriented programming using the Java
language. In this class we will be using [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org)
and [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/) as development environments.
You will learn about writing programs, designing simple algorithms, about
control structures, data types and structures, objects and classes.

## Language

This class will be held in german, but all (or almost all) written material will
be in English. You are free to choose either language for your written assignments.

## Meetings

The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab per week. Find the details in
LSF.

## Grades

Your grade in Info1 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated elements of the course (Lecture summaries, lab reports and exam). The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale]({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/grading-scale):

* Exam: 90%
* Lecture summaries: 10%
* Lab reports:
    * You need an "ok" on more than 10 out of 13 to be admitted to
the exam
    * 13 "ok": 5% extra
* Q&A in Grasp: up to 5% extra


### Lecture summaries
In the Moodle collaboration room you can find a section called "Lecture summaries". You are expected to write 5-10 complete sentences summarizing each lecture.

Lecture summaries are due at 23.00 the Monday for both lectures of the past week. They are either done or not done. I expect you to do 20 out of all (which will be slightly more) to get the full 10%.
 If I find plagiarisms of lecture summaries (especially from the Wikipedia), you will not get any credit for **any** lecture summary.

### Lab Reports
You find detailled information about them on the [Lab Page](labs/)

### Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination at the end of the term. We will have 2 shifts of exams, Group 1 and Group 2. The examination will cover Java programming and conceptual understanding in ways that may be difficult to assess during the laboratory sessions. The exam will be an on-line exam with two parts, a multiple-choice part and an essay / programming part. Please consult LSF for the definite date and time.

## Tutorial and Lernzentrum

If you struggle with this class, need more support with the exercises or simply don't like studying alone (or my lectures):
There is a tutorial held by Alexander Becker and the [Lernzentrum Informatik](/broken_link) that offer opportunities to practice.

* Tutorial:  Tuesdays  08:00-09:30 in WH-C 576 (Alexander Becker) [Homepage](https://home.htw-berlin.de/~s0533351/termine.html)

## Java-Tutorials and Book

Most of this lecture will be based on: D. Barnes; M. Kölling: **Objects first with Java. A Practical Introduction using BlueJ**; Pearson Education. 5th edition.

German translation: Barnes, David J., Kölling, Michael: Java lernen mit BlueJ. Pearson, 2012, 5. Auflage. [Pearson](https://www.pearson.de/java-lernen-mit-bluej-9783868949117)

You can also obtain an older edition - examples and chapter order vary, but the general content is the same.

There are tons of Java Tutorials out there on the web, my recommendation are the [Tutorials by Sun/now Oracle][7]; especially the [Trail &#8220;Learning the Java Language&#8221;][8], as they are very concise and comprehensive.

## Important Links and Further Information

On the top of the page you find a couple of links you'll find you'll be using a lot during the term:


Information on this class is dispersed depending on the nature of the information and wether it should be public or not.

* These pages for publicly accessible information, especially the [Schedule](schedule), [Lab](labs) exercises, or further general information as the [Grading Scale]({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/grading-scale)
* Moodle (link above) for all Information that cannot be made publicly available and for handing in your lecture notes and lab reports
* [Github](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1) for publicly accessible code examples used in the lecture and the assignments (you don't need to know how to use git to use github - note the "download as zip" buttons on the starting page of each repository!)
*  last not least [LSF System](https://lsf.htw-berlin.de), where you can find class times and rooms. Note that is possible to see the general schedule for your Semester (Term Schedule above) and also Schedules for all people teaching ([Dozentenpläne](https://lsf.htw-berlin.de/qisserver/rds?state=change&type=5&moduleParameter=personDPlanSearch&nextdir=change&next=search.vm&subdir=person)) - this is often the fastest way to find out the room for your next class.
