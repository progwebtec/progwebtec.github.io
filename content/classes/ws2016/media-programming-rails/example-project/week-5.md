# Week 5

Example Project for this week:
[Example Project for Week 5 on GitHub: Notebook](https://github.com/media-programming-rails/notebook)

It's just an app with one resource, Note, which has one attribute, content.

I used JavaScript to add Notes on the notes#index page without reloading the page,
following the example ["A Simple Example" in the Rails Guides on AJAX](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#a-simple-example).

[This is the commit](https://github.com/media-programming-rails/notebook/commit/0318b1f97abd8f3cf8314c59372243dba6e5ba93) where I added the changes described in the tutorial.
