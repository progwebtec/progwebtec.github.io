This e-learning is about watching one of the many talks about Agile Software Development / Software Craftship / S.O.L.I.D. or TDD principles
available on YouTube and summarizing it.

I'll post a more detailed overview of my recommendations later this week.

For the summary, consider doing it as a sketchnote; see my [Sketchnotes](material/visual/sketchnotes/) page for a pointer how to start.
Upload your summary/sketchnote together with the video reference & link (see the [Info on Scribbr on how to reference a YouTube Video](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-examples/youtube/))

I've started collecting videos [here: SE-Videos](/bibliographies/se_videos/) and in [YouTube-Playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@BarneKleinen/playlists) - 
but feel free to find one yourself either from one of the speakers

Or from the Conference Services
