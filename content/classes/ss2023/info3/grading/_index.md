## Course Requirements & Grading

To pass Info3, you need to participate in the Labs and pass the written (Moodle) Exam:

- handing in **all** the labs (12) is a pre-requirement for attending the exam.
- you need to get an "ok" for at least 11 out of the 12 labs. This "ok" is dependent on your ability to be able to present/explain your work in the lab
- your Points in the Exam will determine your grade according to the [Grading Scale](../../../../studies/grading/grading-scale).

## Late Slots and Not-Oks

You can hand in one lab late and miss one time you needed to present (note that there is a 14:1 chance that you don't need to present that day).
If you need to miss more than that for whatever reason, come talk to me.

## Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination at the end of the semester.

## I have already taken Info3 last semester and passed the labs!

Congrats! Tell Prof. Kleinen and the Prof that tought your previous Info3 you would like to use your lab results for this term.


## Late Submissions

**Late submissions** You may hand in one (1) report (with code if applicable) in the late slot on Moodle until a date to be specified, before the first Exam.
