#### Agile Topic

No specific agile topic to be covered in this sprint. Continue to follow the Scrum methodology in your development work, correcting any issues that
you may encounter.

#### Development Topic: Securing a REST API

Lessons 28 and 29 describe mechanisms to secure a RESTful API. Choose a user story that benefits from exposing a secure REST API and implement
it in your application context.

##### Topic of the Week

JWT:

- Implement security for your RESTful API.
- Work with git. Create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
  - You may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- Tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_11"
- Include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - Please use a public repository or grant read access to the lecturer

#### Status Report

Write up a brief status report containing:

- Your project name
- The names of all team members
- The backlog as a text file
- The stories you've implemented in this sprint
- A reflection on any technical issues that you have encountered and how you resolved them (or not)
  - What happens if and when the JWT token expires?
- The url of your git repositories

and submit it as .txt or .pdf to Moodle with the filename _Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint11.pdf_ or
