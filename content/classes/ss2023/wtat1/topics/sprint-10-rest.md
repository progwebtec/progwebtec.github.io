#### Agile Topic: Sprint Retrospective

Hold a sprint retrospective meeting for the current sprint. Discuss process and external issues that prevented you from working towards the sprint goal,
e.g. capacity limitations. Agree on steps to improve the situation for upcoming sprints.

#### Development Topic: Building a REST API

Lessons 26 and 27 introduce RESTful APIs and describe the steps to add support for such APIs to your application. Choose a user story that benefits
from a headless REST API and implement it in your application context.

##### Topic of the Week

REST and AJAX:

- Implement a RESTful API for your application, based on an appropriate user story. Security for this API can be disregarded in this sprint; it will be
  added in the next sprint.
- Work with git. Create a branch for each story and merge it into master with a merge commit like "Story_001 Overview of Study Program"
  - You may also clean your git history to just have one commit per story.
- Tag the version where the sprint was completed with "Sprint_10"
- Include the repo url in your status report (you can use any service, e.g. https://gitlab.rz.htw-berlin.de/)
  - Please use a public repository or grant read access to the lecturer

#### Status Report

Write up a brief status report containing:

- Your project name
- The names of all team members
- The backlog as a text file
- The stories you've implemented in this sprint
- A reflection on any technical issues that you have encountered and how you resolved them (or not)
  - What changes would be necessary to turn your REST API into a (set of) microservice(s)? 
- The url of your git repositories

and submit it as .txt or .pdf to Moodle with the filename _Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint10.pdf_ or
_Group\_\<X\>\_Project\_\<Y\>\_Sprint10.txt.
