# Welcome!

Info 1 is an introduction to object-oriented programming using the Java language. In this class we will be using BlueJ as the main development environment and learn about writing little programs, designing simple algorithms, about control structures, data types and structures, objects and classes. The class consists of 2x2h of lectures and 2h of lab, all happening on Thursdays. You&#8217;ll find all information about the when & where in LSF:  [SU][1], [Lab][2].

**Exercises**

Programming is something you can&#8217;t learn out of a book &#8211; you have try out things yourself and practice! Therefore, this class will have lots of exercises. You need to hand in and be able to present at least 8 out of 12 Exercises to be allowed to the Exam, and 11 to get full Points. Exercises are due Wednesday nights at 11 p.m. / 23:00.
