## What happens in a lab?

Programming is something you can&#8217;t learn out of a book &#8211; you have
try out things yourself and practice! Therefore, this class will have lots of
exercises. In the Labs you will have opportunity to work on them, and, most
importantly, **ask questions** or **discuss it with others** if something is
unclear to you or you are stuck somewhere.

## Structure of the Exercises

Each exercise has a **Pre-Lab** section. preperatory work that you are expected to **complete** - together with reading through the whole exercise - **before coming to lab**.

## Grading: Lab Reports

You will need to write a report each week. The report must be in English or German,
spell-checked and using complete sentences, explaining what you did in the
exercise session, that is, the process. Screenshots are welcome. Each report
should not be more than 5 pages and in PDF format and must have your names on it.
It must include a reflection on what you learned during the session.
They must be submitted to the Moodle area by 22.00 the night before your next lab.

[Here are some general guidelines on lab reports.]({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/guideline)

The reports count 50% of your grade.

## Group Work

Labs and lab reports will be done in groups of three. These groups will be formed at
random at the beginning of each lab. Each group member gets the same grade for the lab report
that gets handed in.

## I could not attend the lab...

Please post in the appropriate Moodle forum. You will be assigned a group. I expect
you to do the exercises anyway and hand in a lab report.

## I can generally not attend the lab on wednesdays / thursdays...

You can switch during "Restplatzbelegungszeitraum" (till October 17 2019). Find someone
who wants to swap places with you, then come talk to me (Linda).

## I have another problem!
Talk to me! You can even do it anonymousely on Moodle.
