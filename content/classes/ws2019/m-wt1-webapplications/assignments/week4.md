# Homework for Week 4

1. Create end-to-end (feature or integration tests) for the feature or feature you've
created last week.
2. Create a test for exercise 2 of last week (search, sort, etc, whatever you've created)
3. create more feature tests if you want to.
4. create a hand-rolled login-procedure following Chapter 8 of [Michael Hartl's Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/). (note: this is to do it once yourself, you wouldn't create your own in a real project, but rather use a library)
5. Do this either test-driven or add feature tests for the successful login.
3. Tag your project: "WEEK04" and push it to github.
9. Upload your PDF-Report to moodle. Your Report should describe what you did, problems you've encountered and how you solved them.
