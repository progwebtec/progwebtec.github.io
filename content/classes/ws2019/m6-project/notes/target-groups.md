# Potential Users/User Groups


- Equality Officers (Frauenbeauftragte)
    - biased: present the institution as inclusive
- Head of Administration/Student Service

- TIN People who are members of the institution
    - who maybe experienced pain and want to share it
    - or maybe a positive experience as well
- Local TIN People who want to provide information
- Alumnis

- Activists Maintaining the Platform/Administrator

- Hochschul-Akteur*innen in Marketing und Gleichstellung
    - goal: good places in rankings, make the institution attractive for potential students


we need to make sure that a variety of people are interviewed (class, sexual orientation, gender identity,
  perspectives of intersex people, people of color)
