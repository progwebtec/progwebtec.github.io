You already know refactoring since Info1 - we spent quite some time refactoring the Zuul project!

This e-learning is about exploring and understanding refactoring in more depth. 

The resource on refactoring:


[Fowler, Martin: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, Addison Wesley Object Technology Series, 1999.](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)

Ruby edition:

[Jay Fields, Shane Harvie, and Martin Fowler: Refactoring Ruby Edition. Addison Wesley, 2009.](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringRubyEd.html)


The latter is discussed in the [Ruby Rouges Podcast #178](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler).

Martin Fowler has also a web page about refactoring 
[https://refactoring.com](https://refactoring.com) - read through the introductionary (first) page and have a look at the [Refactorings Catalogue](https://refactoring.com/catalog/).

Recall the [Zuul Project from Info1](https://github.com/htw-imi-info1/exercise10). Which refactorings did we do there? Find them in the Catalog.

Open up Eclipse and find the automated refactorings it offers. Find them in the Catalog, and list them.
