# Homework for Week 5 / Sprint 1

0. Provide a short description for your Project: Goals/Vision, which Technologies you want to use.
1. Create a backlog for your Project. See  [https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/a-sample-format-for-a-spreadsheet-based-product-backlog](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/a-sample-format-for-a-spreadsheet-based-product-backlog) for an example. Make sure your stories have an ID and that
you have a way to prioritize your backlog.
2. Decide on one, two or a few stories you want to start with. You're still learning the technology, but you should have a goal you're aiming at.
3. Mark those stories as being part of Sprint 1 either in the backlog or in some other way.
4. Make sure to mark the basic installation as your "initial commit" and document each step with a commit reading something like "Story 4711: did this and that"
5. Use the simple git workflow described in the links below to generate merges per story.
3. Tag your project: "SPRINT1" and push it to github (or another git server). Provide a link in your report.
9. Upload your PDF-Report to moodle. Your Report should describe what you did, problems you've encountered and how you solved them - and the project description, the backlog and the stories you worked on during the sprint.
