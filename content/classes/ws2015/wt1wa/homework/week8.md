# Homework for Week 8 / Sprint 4

0. If you haven't done that yet, start testing your application.
1. Define your level of done. [see this article, for example.](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2008/september/what-is-definition-of-done-(dod))
1. Perform a Sprint Planning in your Team.
2. Document the Tasks you identified for each of your stories.
3. Decide on which stories you want to commit - that is, you are pretty sure you can complete till the next deadline.
4. It's ok to plan another story (or two) that you don't yet commit on. Make sure to mark the stories clearly - which do you promise to deliver, which are an option?
5. Work on the stories, preferably, if it is possible at all, the whole team on the first story, then the second. The defined tasks might help with that.
3. Tag your project: "SPRINT4" and push it to github (or another git server). Provide a link in your report.
9. Upload your PDF-Report to moodle. Your Report should describe what you did, problems you've encountered and how you solved them - and the project description, the backlog and the stories you worked on during the sprint.
