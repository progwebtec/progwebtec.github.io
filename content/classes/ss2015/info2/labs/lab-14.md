## Pre-Lab

## Assignment


## Lab Report / What to turn in

Your report is due the day before your next lab (for exact times, please refer to moodle).

Submit a Report in PDF Format and the Source Code as Zipped file.

As in Informatics 1, I am more interested in process than in product,
although we are now getting more interested in products as well.
Your report should include any collaborators on top of the first page,
summarize what you learned,
and note the time you invested in this exercise.
Both of you need to upload the same report in PDF format to Moodle before the
deadline.

### Special Questions for your report
How many lines of code did you write for each class? Record this statistic in your report.
