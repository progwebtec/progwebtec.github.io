## Notebook: Chapter Summaries and Exercises

We will provide Paper Worksheets for each Chapter and encourage you to print
them out and work on them with real pens.

They will be provided in a format that allows you to bind them as a book
later if you wish to.

See [Frau Schimpf: DIY: Buchbinden – Offene Fadenheftung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5iMJxdN5KE)
for an easy german instruction how this might be done, or
[How to Make a Sketchbook | DIY Coptic Stitch Bookbinding Tutorial | Sea Lemon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2FRKbQI2kY&t=307s) for
an english one which also shows a different way to attach the cover.

You may also decide to just bind the individual parts as simple booklet: [DIY: Buchbinden – Einfache Heftbindung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1DdJa9XHeI)

## Update 23.4.2021

- make sure all pages have the correct orientation! (0P otherwise)
- no empty pages, please.
- if you want to start with Sketchnotes, [here are some pointers](/material/visual/sketchnotes/)
### Grading

To get the points for the Chapter Summaries and Exercises, your Notebook Pages
need to be uploaded as PDF to the moodle area on Thursday 22:00.


They need to be **in focus and rotated correctly**.
This can be achieved with a scanner, exporting a document containing the
photographed pages as PDF or with a suitable app. Invest some time in finding
out how you can do that easily at the beginning of term.
