## Sprint 08: Work through the Vue Tutorial

Work through the Vue Tutorial, at least the Introduction and Components In-Depth: [https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) (make sure you hit vue 3!)

Play around with component that might be useful/used within your app - this is
just a preparation sprint, you won't be implementing any new functionality for your app.

## Backlog and Report


- write a summary of what worked, what didn't work and what you've learned as your report and upload it in the moodle area.
- include a personal reflection about the sprint and what you've learned from each team member in the report.
