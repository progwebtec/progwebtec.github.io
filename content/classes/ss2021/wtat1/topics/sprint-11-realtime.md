## Sprint 11: Real-Time-Communication  with socket.io
Find something in your app that may benefit from real-time communication,
as described in Unit 7 - Real-Time Communication
possibly combined with vue, and implement it.

Alternatively, you may decide on another JavaScript Library that would be
useful within your app and implement some functionality using that library.

## Backlog and Report

- make sure to define your stories and connect them to the appropriate technical
topic in the [Backlog](https://backlog.f4.htw-berlin.de/#/courses/4-web-technology-aktuelle-themen-agile-web-development) -

- write a summary of what worked, what didn't work and what you've learned as your report and upload it in the moodle area.
- include a personal reflection about the sprint and what you've learned from each team member in the report.
