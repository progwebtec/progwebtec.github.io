# Heuristical Analysis of Example Application, Topic Definition

## E-Learning: Usability Heuristics
This is not part of the Assignment 01 per se, but needs to be done as a preparation.

We got a rough overview of Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics in class.
Your e-learning assignment is to study all of them and write a short summary
(2-3 pages). This should be done individually, as preparation for the group work.

Read these articles, summarize them and upload your summary to moodle:

* [Main Article: 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
* All Individual Heuristic Articles linked from the Main Article.
* [Examples of the 10 heuristics in Web applications](https://designingwebinterfaces.com/6-tips-for-a-great-flex-ux-part-5)
* Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich. 1990. Heuristic evaluation of user interfaces. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '90), Jane Carrasco Chew and John Whiteside (Eds.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 249-256. (Moodle)

## Assignment01 / A: Heuristic Evaluation

Following the article [How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/),
perform a heuristic evaluation of the example application. Each of you conducts
at least one evaluation. You may either take notes yourself or pair up and switch being notetakers.
Document your choice in the report. If may evaluate more than one application,
but have at least two evaluations on one app to practice aggregating them.

## Assignment01 / B: Project Focus
Following the Questions provided in Moodle - 03-project-focus.pdf -  
Create a document describing the project focus for the topic you are the experts
for as well as the project focus for the project you will be designing.
You start to work on these documents together during the second lab, but finish them
only in your group for completing this assignment.

If the heuristic evaluations spark new ideas for the
project, include them in the document. The project focus for your expert topic
is to further establish your expert status and for practice, do *not* share
the results with the design team working on the topic! They are to explore
your user needs via interviews and develop their own project focus (and design).

## Report
Create a PDF-Report - one document for the whole group, stating all your names,
each one of you needs to upload this same report in PDF format to moodle -
containing the reports results of your heuristic evaluations and the two project
focus descriptions.
