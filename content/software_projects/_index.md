# Software Development Projects

I've collected a range of projects that tackle processes and functionality needed
at the HTW - providing the possibility of developing against a real use case which is
accessible for students, as well of gaining experience with a larger, long-running
source code base.

## Module Handbook
The **Module-Handbook** was the basis of a the collaborative editorial process between
several universities to create the initial curricula for the 12 study programs
for the newly founded  German International University of Cairo. It is currently
 beeing ported into the IT of the [GIU](https://www.giu-uni.de/) in Cairo
( [GIU AS Project](https://www.htw-berlin.de/forschung/online-forschungskatalog/projekte/projekt/?eid=2839).
the data source for information on the website as well as extended to support
basis for further curricula maintenance and development.
More Information: [Modulehandbook](https://https://modulehandbook.github.io/) (Rails)

### The **[StudyPlan](https://github.com/htw-imi-projects/studyplan)** (MEVN)
is a service working on top of the Module-Handbook data (exported in json) which
allows students to plan out their individual Studienplan (developed within a
Bachelor's Thesis) which has been extended to support fair elective course
registration and admission in a practice project and a bachelor's thesis:

## IMI-Map
The first version of the **IMI-Map** supports the Administration of Internships in
our Bachelor's Program since the Summer Term of 2013 and has been developed
and extended in various bachelor's theses and three practice projects, and also
be ported to the MEVN-Stack: [IMI-Map goes MEVN]({{< ref "/classes/ss2021/project" >}} "IMI-Map") (Rails & MEVN)
